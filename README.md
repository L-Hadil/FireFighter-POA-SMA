#  Project Overview

This project implements a simulation of a firefighting scenario using agents within a grid environment. The `FireAgent` spreads fire through the grid using Greedy Algorithm to get into Targets, while the `FireFighterAgent` attempts to extinguish it and save objectives based on A* algorithm. This implementation incorporates Greedy algorithms, including A* **(Not Implemented yet)**, to optimize the movement of agents towards their targets. The system demonstrates fundamental concepts of multi-agent systems, grid-based simulations, and algorithmic strategies for decision-making.

Also i included a synchronization into the code, general idea boolean variable that ensure the game goes turn by turn starting with FireAgent and then FireFighterAgent...vice versa
