#  Project Overview

This project implements a simulation of a firefighting scenario using agents within a grid environment. The `FireAgent` spreads fire through the grid using BFS algorithm to get into Targets, while the `FireFighterAgent` attempts to extinguish it and save objectives based on Greedy algorithms. This implementation incorporates Greedy algorithms, including BFS, to optimize the movement of agents towards their targets. The system demonstrates fundamental concepts of multi-agent systems, grid-based simulations, and algorithmic strategies for decision-making.

Also i included a synchronization into the code, general idea boolean variable that ensure the game goes turn by turn starting with FireAgent and then FireFighterAgent...vice versa
