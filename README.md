#  Project Overview

This project implements a simulation of a firefighting scenario using agents within a grid environment. The `FireAgent` spreads fire through the grid using Greedy Algorithm to get into Targets, while the `FireFighterAgent` attempts to extinguish it and save objectives. This implementation incorporates Greedy algorithms, including A*(Not Implemented yet), to optimize the movement of agents towards their targets. The system demonstrates fundamental concepts of multi-agent systems, grid-based simulations, and algorithmic strategies for decision-making.
